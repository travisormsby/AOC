    "I also struggled with figuring out how to deal with non-main-loop pipes that terminated in the same location as main loop pipe. For example \"-F\". The left-side character suggests that the pipe goes into the right-side character, but there's no corresponding way for that pipe to enter the right-side character. I solved this by first using a directed graph, and then converting to an undirected graph keeping only those edges appear in both directions."
