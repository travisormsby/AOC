# AOC22

This rep tracks my attempts to solve the puzzles of the [2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in Python.

My solutions to each day's puzzles are in a single Jupyter Notebook. Solutions for a day's puzzle won't be posted if there are still open slots on the leaderboard (unlikely for me in any case).
