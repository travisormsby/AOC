# AOC

This repo tracks my attempts to solve the puzzles for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in Python.

My solutions to each day's puzzles are in a single Jupyter Notebook. Solutions for a day's puzzle won't be posted if there are still open slots on the leaderboard (unlikely for me in any case).

aoc.py is a helper function to download the day's input file. You will need your session cookie to access this file.
